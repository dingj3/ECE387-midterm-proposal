//This file is the midterm proposal due to 2/26/2016, for the course ECE387, taught by professor Yamuna Rajasekhar.

In the midterm project, I will use the audrino board to create a lock combined from the electronic lock and mechanical lock.

By using the both lock technics, it will cover the disadvantage that electronic lock only depend on the program so that it is relatively easy to be delocked.
